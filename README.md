# hw-13-burger-app

This project we were tasked with creating an application that could create and store different kinds of burgers and then once "eaten" via a button command it would show on the right side of the page. This was to be done using heroku to deploy the app, sql work bench for the data bases, and various dependencies for the buildout.
# Installation
jaws
express
sql
sqlworkbench
handle-bars
j-query
heroku


# Usage
This app could be used to track what food items someone has eaten and could be tracked locally on their computer or through the deployed heroku site.
